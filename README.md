# Angular Electron Dream Starter with Webpack 2

> A starter kit for [Electron](https://electron.atom.io) and [Angular 4](https://angular.io) featuring [Webpack 2](https://webpack.js.org), [AoT](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/aot-compiler.html) compile, [NGRX Store](https://github.com/ngrx/store), Electron unit tests, native E2E tests in [Spectron](http://electron.atom.io/spectron/), and a powerful development workflow with [Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement-with-webpack.html) and [Electron Connect](https://github.com/Quramy/electron-connect).

Forked from [AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter).

I designed this seed repo to demonstrate an ideal development workflow and the most powerful tools for developing desktop applicaitons using Angular and Electron. `npm start` launches a powerful development workflow which uses Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for nearly instant updates inside the browser window, while also restarting your app automatically every time you update the code of the main process.

* Best practices in desktop application development with Angular and Electron.
* Ready to go build system using Webpack 2 for working with TypeScript.
* Automated bundling of app dependencies, including rebuilding native modules
* Easily package your app for release on Mac, Linux or Windows and create installers
* Ahead of Time (AoT) compile for rapid page loads of your production builds.
* Tree shaking to automatically remove unused code from your production bundle.
* [Webpack DLLs](https://robertknight.github.io/posts/webpack-dll-plugins/) dramatically speed your development builds.
* Testing Angular code inside Electron with Jasmine and Karma.
* Coverage with Istanbul and Karma
* End-to-end application testing with Spectron (using Mocha and Chai).
* Bundled with Devtron and Redux DevTools extensions for debugging in development mode
* Type manager with @types
* Hot Module Replacement with Webpack and [@angularclass/hmr](https://github.com/angularclass/angular2-hmr) and [@angularclass/hmr-loader](https://github.com/angularclass/angular2-hmr-loader)

### Quick start
**Make sure you have Node version >= 6.0 and NPM >= 3**
> Clone/Download the repo then edit `app.component.ts` inside [`/src/app/app.component.ts`](/src/app/app.component.ts)

```bash
# clone our repo
# --depth 1 removes all but one .git commit history
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/colinskow/angular-electron-dream-starter.git

# change directory to our repo
cd angular-electron-dream-starter

# install the repo with npm
npm install

# launch the development build
npm start

# if you're in China use cnpm
# https://github.com/cnpm/cnpm
```
Electron will automatically launch and update itself when your source code changes.

## File Structure
We use the component approach in our starter. This is the new standard for developing Angular apps and a great way to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of our behavior logic. A component is basically a self contained app usually in a single file or a folder with each concern as a file: style, template, specs, e2e, and component class. Here's how it looks:
```

# Getting Started

## Dependencies
What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (`brew install node`)
* Ensure you're running the latest versions Node `v6.x.x`+ (or `v7.x.x`) and NPM `3.x.x`+

> If you have `nvm` installed, which is highly recommended (`brew install nvm`) you can do a `nvm install --lts && nvm use` in `$` to run with the latest Node LTS. You can also have this `zsh` done for you [automatically](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#calling-nvm-use-automatically-in-a-directory-with-a-nvmrc-file) 

Once you have those, you should install these globals with `npm install --global`:
* `electron` (`npm install --global electron`)
* `webpack` (`npm install --global webpack`)
* `karma` (`npm install --global karma-cli`)
* `typescript` (`npm install --global typescript`)

## Installing
* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install` to install all dependencies or `yarn`
* `npm start` to start the development workflow

## Building

```bash
# development
npm run build:dev
# production (jit)
npm run build:prod
# AoT
npm run build:aot
```

## Launching Your Build

```bash
npm run launch
```

## Generating Release Packages

Make sure to build your app first. Application packages files will be generated inside the `/packages` directory.

```bash
# all platforms
npm run package
# Linux
npm run package:linux
# Mac
npm run package:mac
# Windows
npm run package:windows
```

## Other Commands

### run unit tests
```bash
npm run test
```

### watch and run our tests
```bash
npm run watch:test
```

### run end-to-end tests
```bash
# this will start a test server and launch Protractor
npm run e2e
```

### continuous integration (run unit tests and e2e tests together)
```bash
# this will test both your JIT and AoT builds
npm run ci
```

### run Webdriver.io's live debug (for end-to-end)
This allows you to debug e2e tests and explore your app while it is running. See the [WebDriver.io documentation](http://webdriver.io/api/utility/debug.html) for details.

```bash
npm run e2e:live
```

### clean application data
```bash
# this will delete all data from localStorage, indexedDB etc.
npm run clean:appdata
```

# Configuration
Configuration files live in `config/`. You can modify the settings for Webpack and Karma here.

The configuration for your Electron build lives inside `package.json` under `build`. You can read the docs [here](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder).

# Managing Dependencies

Each package listed in `package.json` under `dependencies` will automatically be packaged with your app and rebuilt for Electron if it contains native bindings. Only list packages here that are necessary for your app's runtime. Angular, CoreJS and related packages are compiled by Webpack and therefore not necessary at runtime. These and anything else not needed to run your app should go under `devDependencies`.

Any time you run `npm install` or `yarn install`, your app dependencies will automatically be built and packaged for your current operating system and architecture. After you run `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`, you will need to manually update app's dependencies are up-to-date as well:

```bash
# if you use yarn
yarn run install-app-deps
# otherwise
npm run install-app-deps
```

# AoT Don'ts
The following are some things that will make AoT compile fail.

- Don’t use require statements for your templates or styles, use styleUrls and templateUrls, the angular2-template-loader plugin will change it to require at build time.
- Don’t use default exports.
- Don’t use `form.controls.controlName`, use `form.get(‘controlName’)`
- Don’t use `control.errors?.someError`, use `control.hasError(‘someError’)`
- Don’t use functions in your providers, routes or declarations, export a function and then reference that function name
- @Inputs, @Outputs, View or Content Child(ren), Hostbindings, and any field you use from the template or annotate for Angular should be public

# External Stylesheets
Any stylesheets (Sass or CSS) placed in the `src/styles` directory and imported into your project will automatically be compiled into an external `.css` and embedded in your production builds.

For example to use Bootstrap as an external stylesheet:

1) Create a `styles.scss` file (name doesn't matter) in the `src/styles` directory.
2) `npm install` the version of Boostrap you want.
3) In `styles.scss` add `@import 'bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss';`
4) In `src/app/app.module.ts` add underneath the other import statements: `import '../styles/styles.scss';`

# Lazy Loading
When you lazy load a module in your router config, it will go into a separate chunk and the browser will download the code after your main application is finished loading. This results in faster start-up time.

You can make a module lazy load by using the `loadChildren` syntax in your route definitions:

```js
{ path: 'detail', loadChildren: './+detail#DetailModule'}
```

To make sure TypeScript compiles your lazy-loaded modules, declare them in `./src/app/lazy-loaded.ts` with an import statement. Declaring the modules allows TypeScript to only compile the necessary files. Previously TS would compile every single `.ts` file in your project tree on every single build which was inefficient and lead to issues.

# Contributing
You can include more examples as components but they must introduce a new concept such as `Home` component (separate folders), and Todo (services). I'll accept pretty much everything so feel free to open a Pull-Request

# TypeScript
> To take full advantage of TypeScript with autocomplete you would have to install it globally and use an editor with the correct TypeScript plugins.

## Use latest TypeScript compiler
TypeScript 2.1.x includes everything you need. Make sure to upgrade, even if you installed TypeScript previously.

```
npm install --global typescript
```

## Use a TypeScript-aware editor
We have good experience using these editors:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [TypeScript plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) with [Typescript-Sublime-Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/Typescript-Sublime-plugin#installation)

### Visual Studio Code + Debugger for Chrome
> Install [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) and see docs for instructions to launch Chrome 

The included `.vscode` automatically connects to the webpack development server on port `3000`.

# Types
> When you include a module that doesn't include Type Definitions inside of the module you can include external Type Definitions with @types

i.e, to have youtube api support, run this command in terminal: 
```shell
npm i @types/youtube @types/gapi @types/gapi.youtube
``` 
In some cases where your code editor doesn't support Typescript 2 yet or these types weren't listed in ```tsconfig.json```, add these to **"src/custom-typings.d.ts"** to make peace with the compile check: 
```es6
import '@types/gapi.youtube';
import '@types/gapi';
import '@types/youtube';
```

## Custom Type Definitions
When including 3rd party modules you also need to include the type definition for the module
if they don't provide one within the module. You can try to install it with @types

```
npm install @types/node
npm install @types/lodash
```

If you can't find the type definition in the registry we can make an ambient definition in
this file for now. For example

```typescript
declare module "my-module" {
  export function doesSomething(value: string): string;
}
```


If you're prototyping and you will fix the types later you can also declare it as type any

```typescript
declare var assert: any;
declare var _: any;
declare var $: any;
```

If you're importing a module that uses Node.js modules which are CommonJS you need to import as

```typescript
import * as _ from 'lodash';
```
